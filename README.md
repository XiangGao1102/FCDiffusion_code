# Frequency-Controlled-Diffusion-Model

# Introduction
This project tackles the problem of text-guided image-to-image (I2I) translation, i.e., translating a source image with a natural-language text prompt. We harness the immense generative power of the pre-trained large-scale text-to-image diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) and extend it to text-guided I2I, providing intelligent tools to facilitate image manipulation or editing tasks.
